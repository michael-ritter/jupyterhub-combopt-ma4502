# Assignments on GitHub

Now we'll build a set of pre-constructed assignments and notes for each JupyterHub user. We'll save these assignments and notes to a GitHub repo.

[TOC]

## Create a repo of assignments on GitHub.com

Log onto to GitHub.com, and create a new repo with the notes and assignments for the course.

Make sure to select [Add .gitignore **Python**]  and select a license.

## Pull the repo down from GitHub.com to the local computer

On a local computer, not the server, clone the GitHub repo. This allows us to work on the notes and assignments locally.

```text
# local computer
$ git clone https://github.com/username/reponame.git
```

## Create the assignments and notes

On the local computer, not the server, build the assignment and notes for the semester. I did this using Jupyter notebooks.

Save all of the changes locally. Add any files that you don't want students to see to .gitignore. Good templates for .gitignore are available over at [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io).

## Push the completed assignments and notes up to GiHub

Finally, add, commit, and push the changes up to GitHub.

```text
# local computer
$ git add .
$ commit -m "added assignments and notes"
$ git push origin master
```

## Summary

In this section, we built a set of notes and assignments for the semester on GitHub. First a new repo was created on GitHub.com. A `````.gitignore````` file corresponding to Python and a license were added to the repo when the repo was created. Next we pulled to repo down to our local computer and built the assignments and notes. Finally we pushed the changes up to Github.

## Next Steps

Next, we'll use a JupyterHub extension called **nbgitpuller** which copies the notes and assignments we just saved to GitHub into each students home folder when they log into JupyterHub.
